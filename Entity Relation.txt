In a Hall Dining Management System, entities are objects or concepts that represent data that is stored in the system. The attributes describe the characteristics or properties of an entity. The cardinality of a relationship between entities determines the number of instances of one entity that can be associated with a single instance of another entity. The primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table.

The identification of entities, attributes, cardinality of relationships, and primary keys for a Hall Dining Management System would depend on the specific requirements and design of the system, but some common entities, attributes, cardinalities, and primary keys are:

Entities:
